# graphs
A graph implementation with given text files
************************************************
The goal of this prgoram is to perform some graph-related operations on Prof. Donald
Knuth’s list of five-letter words in GraphBase (Donald E. Knuth, “The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing,” ACM Press, New York, 1993). In this
data set, each word is a vertex and two vertices are connected by an undirected edge if the
corresponding words differ in only one letter. For example, roger and rover are connected
but roger and pager are not.
This program allows users to do some operations on this
word network. These operations should are implemented in a class named WordNetwork
with all related code in the files named WordNetwork.h and WordNetwork.cpp
